## Year in Review: 2024

2024 has been a transformative year of technical excellence and innovation. Our team successfully delivered production-ready solutions across the technology spectrum, from bare-metal embedded systems to modern mobile applications.

This year, our work focused on two major engagements, involving deep expertise in **FreeRTOS**, **Swift/SwiftUI**, and **real-time collaboration systems**. We modernized legacy architectures into maintainable, scalable platforms while ensuring reliability through comprehensive testing and secure update mechanisms.

## Key Achievements

*   **RTOS Firmware Migration:** Successfully transitioned legacy bare-metal firmware to a modern FreeRTOS-based architecture, enabling preemptive multitasking and improved power management.
*   **Secure OTA Updates:** Developed a dual-bank firmware architecture with Ed25519 cryptographic signature verification, enabling secure field updates with automatic rollback on failure.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Built a full-featured iOS application with WebSocket-based real-time collaboration, offline-first architecture, and seamless data synchronization.
*   **Automated Testing:** Established comprehensive hardware-in-the-loop testing frameworks with CI/CD integration, ensuring regression-free releases.
*   **Manufacturing Readiness:** Created dedicated manufacturing test modes, device provisioning workflows, and quality assurance systems.

## Technologies & Expertise

*   **Embedded & IoT:** FreeRTOS, C, STM32 microcontrollers, I2C/SPI sensor integration, and hardware abstraction layers.
*   **Mobile & Desktop:** Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, Core Data, and WebSocket communication.
*   **Backend Development:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis pub/sub, and JWT authentication.
*   **Tooling & DevOps:** Python test automation, pytest, CI/CD pipelines, and crash reporting integration.

## By the Numbers

*   **2** Major Projects Delivered
*   **668** Total Commits across all repositories
*   **39,000+** Lines of Code added
*   **100** Active Development Days
*   **6** Core Technologies mastered

## Looking Ahead

The foundations laid this year in **secure firmware updates** and **offline-first mobile architecture** position us to tackle increasingly complex connected device projects. Our demonstrated ability to work across the full technology stack—from microcontroller firmware to mobile apps to backend APIs—enables us to deliver complete, production-ready solutions.

We remain committed to engineering excellence, emphasizing reliability, maintainability, and user experience in every project we undertake.
