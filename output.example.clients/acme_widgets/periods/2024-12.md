December concluded the quarter with a focus on production readiness, including OTA update support, manufacturing test modes, and comprehensive documentation. The firmware is now ready for initial production runs.

### Key Changes & Features
*   **Over-the-Air Updates**
    *   Implemented a dual-bank firmware architecture enabling safe OTA updates with automatic rollback on failure.
    *   Added firmware signature verification using Ed25519 for secure update authentication.
    *   Created a staged update process: download, verify, apply, and confirm.
*   **Manufacturing Support**
    *   Developed a dedicated manufacturing test mode with automated hardware verification sequences.
    *   Implemented unique device ID programming and certificate provisioning workflows.
    *   Added QR code generation for device labeling with serial numbers and calibration data.
*   **Documentation & Release Prep**
    *   Created comprehensive API documentation for the serial command protocol.
    *   Wrote integration guides for common host platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).
    *   Prepared release notes and changelog automation scripts.

### Technologies & Languages
*   **Embedded C:** Bootloader development and cryptographic verification routines.
*   **Python:** Manufacturing tools and documentation generation scripts.
*   **Ed25519:** Asymmetric cryptography for firmware authentication.

### Patterns & Architecture
*   **A/B Partitioning:** Dual firmware banks ensure a known-good image is always available for recovery.
*   **Chain of Trust:** Bootloader verifies application signature before execution, preventing unauthorized code.
*   **Atomic Updates:** Configuration changes are written to shadow storage and committed atomically.
