December wrapped up the quarter with App Store preparation, performance optimization, and analytics integration. The app achieved a successful TestFlight release with positive beta tester feedback.

### Key Changes & Features
*   **App Store Preparation**
    *   Completed App Store Connect metadata including screenshots, descriptions, and keywords.
    *   Implemented App Store review compliance features: account deletion, privacy labels, and age ratings.
    *   Created an onboarding flow with feature highlights and permission request explanations.
*   **Performance Optimization**
    *   Profiled and optimized list rendering using lazy loading and cell recycling.
    *   Implemented image caching with progressive loading for improved perceived performance.
    *   Reduced app launch time by 40% through dependency injection optimization.
*   **Analytics & Monitoring**
    *   Integrated analytics for user behavior tracking with privacy-preserving techniques.
    *   Added crash reporting with symbolicated stack traces and breadcrumb trails.
    *   Implemented custom event tracking for key user journey milestones.

### Technologies & Languages
*   **Swift:** Performance profiling with Instruments and optimization implementation.
*   **TypeScript:** API response time monitoring and alerting.
*   **Firebase:** Analytics, crash reporting, and performance monitoring.

### Patterns & Architecture
*   **Lazy Initialization:** Deferred loading of non-critical components for faster app launch.
*   **Image Pipeline:** Multi-tier caching (memory, disk, network) with automatic size optimization.
*   **Privacy by Design:** Analytics data is anonymized client-side before transmission.
