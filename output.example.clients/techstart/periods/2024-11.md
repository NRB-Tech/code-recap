November was dedicated to building the core product features: real-time collaboration and data synchronization. The implementation supports offline-first operation with seamless conflict resolution when connectivity returns.

### Key Changes & Features
*   **Real-Time Collaboration**
    *   Implemented WebSocket-based real-time updates for shared workspace changes.
    *   Built an operational transformation engine for concurrent text editing without conflicts.
    *   Added presence indicators showing which team members are viewing or editing content.
*   **Offline-First Architecture**
    *   Implemented local SQLite storage for offline data access and modification.
    *   Created a sync engine that queues changes and reconciles with the server on reconnection.
    *   Added conflict detection with user-friendly resolution UI for divergent edits.
*   **Push Notifications**
    *   Integrated Apple Push Notification service (APNs) for real-time alerts.
    *   Implemented notification categories with actionable buttons for quick responses.
    *   Added notification preferences allowing users to customize alert types and schedules.

### Technologies & Languages
*   **Swift:** Core Data integration and sync engine implementation.
*   **TypeScript:** WebSocket server and operational transformation logic.
*   **Redis:** Pub/sub for broadcasting real-time updates across server instances.

### Patterns & Architecture
*   **Event Sourcing:** Changes are stored as immutable events, enabling replay and audit trails.
*   **CRDT-Inspired Sync:** Conflict-free data structures for automatic merge of concurrent changes.
*   **Background Tasks:** iOS background app refresh keeps local data synchronized.
