November focused on scaling the analytics platform and introducing performance monitoring capabilities. Key achievements include real-time alerting systems and the foundation of a Rust-based performance agent.

### Key Changes & Features
*   **Analytics Dashboard Expansion**
    *   Added custom dashboard builder allowing users to create personalized metric views.
    *   Implemented data export functionality with CSV, JSON, and PDF report generation.
    *   Built notification system with email and Slack integration for threshold alerts.
*   **Performance Monitoring Agent**
    *   Developed lightweight Rust agent for system metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk, network).
    *   Created efficient data compression and batching for minimal network overhead.
    *   Implemented secure communication channel using TLS with certificate pinning.
*   **API Development**
    *   Built RESTful API endpoints for dashboard data access with rate limiting.
    *   Added GraphQL layer for flexible query capabilities.
    *   Implemented caching strategy with Redis for frequently accessed metrics.

### Technologies & Languages
*   **Rust:** High-performance agent development with async runtime (tokio).
*   **TypeScript:** Dashboard feature expansion with advanced state management (Zustand).
*   **Redis:** Caching layer for API responses and real-time metric buffering.

### Patterns & Architecture
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Metrics flow through message queues for decoupled processing.
*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Resilient external service integration with automatic fallbacks.
*   **Incremental Rollouts:** Feature flags enabling gradual deployment of new capabilities.
