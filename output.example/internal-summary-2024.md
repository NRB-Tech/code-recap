## Company Year in Review

The fourth quarter of 2024 demonstrated our versatility across the technology spectrum, from bare-metal embedded systems to modern mobile applications. We successfully delivered production-ready solutions for two very different clients: a complete firmware modernization for Acme Widgets and a full-featured iOS application launch for TechStart.

Our embedded systems work showcased deep expertise in real-time operating systems, secure firmware updates, and hardware-software integration. Meanwhile, our mobile development demonstrated mastery of modern Swift/SwiftUI patterns, real-time collaboration systems, and offline-first architecture. This breadth of capability positions us uniquely to tackle complex projects that span multiple technology domains.

Both projects emphasized reliability and maintainability: the widget firmware features comprehensive automated testing and secure OTA updates, while the TechStart app employs event sourcing and conflict-free sync for bulletproof data integrity. This focus on "production-ready" engineering differentiates our work from prototype-quality deliverables.

## Client Highlights

*   **Acme Widgets:** Transformed legacy bare-metal firmware into a modern RTOS-based platform with secure OTA updates, comprehensive sensor fusion, and manufacturing automation.
*   **TechStart:** Delivered a feature-complete iOS application with real-time collaboration, offline-first architecture, and successful App Store submission in a single quarter.

## Technical Capabilities Demonstrated

*   **Embedded Systems:** FreeRTOS task design, power management implementation, secure bootloader development, I2C/SPI sensor integration, and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
*   **Mobile Development:** SwiftUI/Combine architecture, Core Data integration, WebSocket real-time communication, push notification implementation, and App Store compliance.
*   **Backend Development:** Node.js/Express API development, PostgreSQL database design, Redis pub/sub integration, and JWT authentication systems.
*   **DevOps & Quality:** CI/CD pipeline setup, automated testing frameworks, crash reporting integration, and performance monitoring.
