October kicked off the mobile app development with a focus on establishing the core architecture and implementing the authentication flow. The foundation supports future feature development while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Key Changes & Features
*   **iOS App Foundation**
    *   Established the project structure using Swift Package Manager for modular dependency management.
    *   Implemented the MVVM architecture with Combine for reactive data binding.
    *   Created a design system with reusable UI components following the brand guidelines.
*   **Authentication System**
    *   Built a complete authentication flow including sign-up, sign-in, password reset, and email verification.
    *   Integrated Sign in with Apple and Google OAuth for streamlined onboarding.
    *   Implemented secure token storage using Keychain with biometric unlock support.
*   **Backend API Development**
    *   Developed RESTful API endpoints for user management and authentication.
    *   Implemented JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation.
    *   Added rate limiting and request validation middleware.

### Technologies & Languages
*   **Swift:** iOS application development using SwiftUI and Combine frameworks.
*   **TypeScript:** Backend API development with Node.js and Express.
*   **PostgreSQL:** Primary database for user data and application state.

### Patterns & Architecture
*   **MVVM:** View-ViewModel separation enables testable business logic and reactive UI updates.
*   **Repository Pattern:** Data access layer abstracts storage implementation details from business logic.
*   **Middleware Pipeline:** Express middleware chain handles cross-cutting concerns like auth and logging.
