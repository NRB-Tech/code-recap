November focused on implementing the sensor fusion subsystem and establishing an automated testing framework. The new sensor architecture enables accurate environmental monitoring while the test infrastructure ensures regression-free releases.

### Key Changes & Features
*   **Sensor Fusion Implementation**
    *   Integrated temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors into a unified environmental monitoring system.
    *   Implemented a Kalman filter for sensor data smoothing and noise reduction.
    *   Added calibration routines with persistent storage of calibration coefficients in flash.
*   **Automated Testing Framework**
    *   Created a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test harness using Python and pytest.
    *   Implemented mock sensor data injection for deterministic test execution.
    *   Added continuous integration support with automated firmware builds and test runs.
*   **LED Status System**
    *   Designed a multi-color LED status indication system with configurable patterns.
    *   Implemented priority-based LED control allowing critical alerts to override normal status.
    *   Added smooth fade transitions between states for improved visual feedback.

### Technologies & Languages
*   **Embedded C:** Sensor driver development and fusion algorithm implementation.
*   **Python:** Test framework development using pytest and hardware control libraries.
*   **I2C/SPI:** Low-level communication with environmental sensors.

### Patterns & Architecture
*   **Observer Pattern:** Sensor subsystem publishes readings to registered listeners, enabling loose coupling.
*   **State Machine:** LED controller uses a hierarchical state machine for managing complex animation sequences.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Test harness uses DI to swap real hardware with mock implementations.
