## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared `add_input_dir_arg()` and `add_output_dir_arg()` functions in `arguments.py` for consistent CLI arguments

### Changed
- HTML command now uses `--input-dir` and `--output-dir` instead of `-i`/`--input` and `-o`/`--output`
- Deploy command uses `--input-dir` instead of `--input`/`-i`
- `--output-dir` alone now uses that directory as input and outputs to `html/` subdirectory (convenience shorthand)
